# Board Theory
Some cool programs for interacting with boards. 

Upon execution, main.py will make a hashmap of around 2000 tension problems. The problems are not up to date, so some of your favorites might be missing. The script will then open a window where you can set a problem. Use your keyboard to change roles:
p: feet
s: start
m: middle
f: finish

then press enter or close the window to search the hashmap for similar problems. 

THIS IS A VERY ROUGH DRAFT NOT INTENDED FOR PRACTICAL USE. This draft mostly serves as a proof of concept.
